Almost anyone who has deployed machine learning systems in the real world has encountered the task of domain adaptation: We build our models from some fixed source domain, but we wish to deploy them across one or more different target domains. 

Object recognition system trained on Amazon and applied to Webcam, Perform poorly

Measures how data distribution has shifted between 2 domains inorder to derive classification rules for the target domain
For instance, covariate shift

The marginal distribution of domains are different across domains while the posterior distribution remains the same

 the labeled instances from the source domain are
first weighted so as to compensate the difference in
marginal distributions. Then, a classifier is trained using
the labels and then applied to the unlabeled data
