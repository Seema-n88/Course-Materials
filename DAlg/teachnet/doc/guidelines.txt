HOW TO PREPARE YOUR SUBMISSION:
===============================

a) Implement the given exercises
b) Make sure your java-files are compilable
c) Make sure you have the correct configurations
d) Make sure your run scripts are working
e) Properly structure your submission:

for example:

OPTION_1:

assignment1
	|- teachnet.path
	|- flooding
		|- run.sh
		|- myconfig.txt
		|- Flooding.java
		|- *.java
	|- echo
		|- run.sh
		|- myconfig.txt
		|- Echo.java
		|- *.java

OPTION_2:

assignment1
	|- teachnet.path
	|- runFlooding.sh
	|- runEcho.sh
	|- flooding-config.txt
	|- echo-config.txt
	|- Flooding.java
	|- Echo.java
	|- *.java

f) Keep naming conventions in mind:
Either use "run.sh" or "runXXX.sh"

g) Keep it simple!
You can use packages, but usually it is not
necessary. However, if your run scripts
are not working I consider your submission
as not working!


WHAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE SUBMISSION
=====================================
 
a) the run script (run.sh)
b) the configuration file (myconfig.txt)
c) the teachnet path file (teachnet.path)
d) your source code files (*.java)


WHAT SHOULD NOT(!) BE PART OF THE SUBMISSION
============================================

a) the entire teachnet (teachnet.jar)
