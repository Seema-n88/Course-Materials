      "In this exercise, you will implement the FastICA algorithm, and apply it to model independent components of a distribution of image patches. The description of the fastICA method is given in the paper *\"A. Hyv\u00e4rinen and E. Oja. 2000. Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications\"* linked from ISIS, and we frequently refer to sections and equations in that paper.\n",
