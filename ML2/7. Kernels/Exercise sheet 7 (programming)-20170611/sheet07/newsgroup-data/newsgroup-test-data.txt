I think "The Yeast Connection" is > a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well > nutrition is taught, anyway?  Elisabeth, let's set the record straight for the nth time, I have not read  "The Yeast Connection".  So anything that I say is not due to brainwashing  by this "hated" book.  It's okay I guess to hate the book, by why hate me? Elisabeth, I'm going to quote from Zinsser's Microbiology, 20th Edition. A book that you should be familiar with and not "hate". "Candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter.  The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.   Indeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis."  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  "sick" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis. Your assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute  it.  What I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic  infection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation (GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial  competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida  blooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser's again: "However, some factors, such as  the use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to  both mucosal and systemic infections".  I was addressing mucosal infections (I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers  this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the "cure".  I guess that  your nutrition course does not, too bad.     >>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  >>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

(shudder) > Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?  My, my Elisabeth, do I detect a little of Steve Dyer in you?  If you  noticed my faculty rank, I'm a biochemist, not a microbiologist. Candida is classifed as a fungus(according to Zinsser's).  But, as you point  out, it displays dimorphism.  It is capable of producing yeast cells,  pseudohyphae and true hyphae.  Elisabeth, you are probably a microbiologist  and that makes a lot of sense to you.  To a biochemist, it's a lot of  Greek.  So I called it a yeast-like fungus, go ahead and crucify me.  You know Elisabeth, I still haven't been able to figure out why such a small  little organism like Candida can bring out so much hostility in people in  Sci. Med.  And I must admitt that I got sucked into the mud slinging too. I keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what  I'v
of Informatica is now out of print and some of you  will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page -- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100); and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views into the discourse.    A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences, mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology  (e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the area in question.    On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published. The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional  achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the  understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.    The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated. A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.    Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.) and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome. You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail. On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.    E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect. You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US, Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So, you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning our common interest and job.  At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and  philosophical orientations as well as t

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement it.  If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well enough to release it by May 15.

Education and Summer Sessions                     Course Description    Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of Lines: 197  molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.   While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology, simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists. Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing.   This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming (IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video recording equipment.   Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art            computer graphics into their research; computer scientists            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of            scientific visualization.              The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a            first-come first-served basis.   Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken            without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra            and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,            X-windows and C is useful but not required.

Daily lectures will be interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience and discuss problems encountered.   Content (may vary)       Elements of computer graphics          polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric          rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow          programming (DX), interactivity.

rs of the "Cold Fusion" papers of  recent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually  left the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I'm still not sure that if a  review of the research notes of the "cold fusion scientists" actually  proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.  Your sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay  texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food  combining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind. But some things I just can't buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent  oxidative damage in the body).  Your experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove  that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you  use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees  I believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in  commercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this  kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I  couldn't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really  guessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is  that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to  produce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so  they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.   Chemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and  in our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve  fusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we  really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with  silicon?  Not in my book Robert.  Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I've seen speculation  that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon  based life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I  know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to  separate the fiction from the fact.  Silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in  humans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What's it doing  there?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know  about silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not  because silicon is transformed into calcium).  Almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective  tissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show  that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective  factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin,  the more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity  which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as  part of the ageing process in humans).  For bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which  calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon  in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the  bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going. Electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming  cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in  the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency (by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of  defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also  another big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an   undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not  transformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing  observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into  calcium is an interesting little trick.  But Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and  yes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without  a very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group  are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don't know any  better).  If the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base,  I'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources  that come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems  to make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I'm  going to give isn't going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us  kindred souls Robert, then I guess I'll have to live with that label.  For the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert's  interesting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric  neurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can't remember the network or his  name(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in  our Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with  brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses"unconventional" treatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one  case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional  treatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the  cost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between  radiation treatment and surgery is guys?   I'm going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the  chronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine) and tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which  do not result in death(like those that the neurosurg

I was also shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only 1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at different x/y values, the "ridges" are out of phase, resulting in the stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap.   Example:   Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)       Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)  Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing. Bravo!  (Note to IBM'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so I
 three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because I feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I went to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.   Anyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant; but he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So I used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly and felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually felt refreshed the next morning.   So,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and experimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The antihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought some generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't notice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about 1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research seems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic form of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try.   For other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry eyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some changes in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I went back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)   Anyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use (Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be a serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good, whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to lower slee

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection  incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest  that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial  because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and  mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).  > -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick? > How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.  > -- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later), > does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it > not have any long term effect?  Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses  mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response( new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline  with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high. Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression  but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.  > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long > term effects?  Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good  bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects  of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the  medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects  of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).   > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than > normal, and what does one do about it?  Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my  opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is  normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many  infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some  physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection  frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to  result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the  length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms  associated with the infection.  > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?  There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong  immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,  vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this  is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low  and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune  response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are  distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of  these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe  infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A  status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for  vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five  nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the  others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far. But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the  critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also  be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a  nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone( like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition. Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's  what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves  nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training  needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good  for getting general dietary advice from however.  > Any

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,     JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has     image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.  NeXT:  ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it. ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   "begin" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   "begin" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For mor
e very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor). I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results (for better or for worse).  I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only 5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.  I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor, keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten frames.  I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier.  Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.  That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.  I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240 size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...  Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.  The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback). A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching.  A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.  I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance even more...  Lawrenc
ate, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, 202-429-1130     WASHINGTON, April 23 -- The American Federation of State,  County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other unions of the AFL-CIO on Wednesday, April 28, will commemorate the fifth annual Workers Memorial Day -- a day to pay homage to the 6 million workers who are killed, injured, or diseased on the job.    This year, AFSCME will focus its Workers Memorial Day efforts an the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work. Earlier this month, an AFSCME corrections officer, Robert Vallandingham, was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections facility in Lucasville, Ohio.    The law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady increase in the prison population for the past five years.  On Jn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections show a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an expected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.    The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the number of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain high.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff, compared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.    The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous combination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio officer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in the nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and safety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis B, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.    AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation's federal, state and local correctional facilities.    Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under life-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers die from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from occupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation's most dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:     -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and       frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are       not barricaded or don't have proper lighting.    -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of       job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector       employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more       than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private       sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the       previous year.  It is generally believed that health care       workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes       have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses       than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety       issues facing health care workers include exposure to       tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high       levels of stress.    -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health       institutions are often the victims of assaults and,       sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man       carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler       County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.       and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the       gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a       growing lack of support services for people who don't have       the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some       clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.       Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.       The "quality" of the clients is also becoming more violent,       as more are moved out of the institutions.     Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards since OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety protections for public employees.    "More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the job, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA coverage for public employees," said McEntee.  "This, despite the fact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers, corrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most dangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for passage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater rights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees safe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful."    Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private sector workers, and these injuries are almost 75
ch from other aids. It appears to me that a new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in 'noisy' situations.  The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable), apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies, while the important consonant information (unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call 'abnormal growth of loudness'.  This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I think the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means that if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point. You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff).  Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency information be

ood & Drug Administration News ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::                FDA Approves Depo Provera, injectable contraceptive                       P92-31 Food and Drug Administration               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Susan Cruzan - (301) 443-3285   The Food and Drug Administration today announced the approval of Depo Provera,  an injectable contraceptive drug.   The drug, which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone  progesterone, protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection.  The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is  released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. It is more than 99 percent  effective.  "This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent  pregnancy," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "As an injectable,  given once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to  missing a daily dose."  Depo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and  clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive  protection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the  injections.  As with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and  risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional  before making a decision to use it.  Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive  studies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies  in other countries. U.S. clinical trials, begun in 1963, also found Depo  Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.  The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. In  addition, some patients may experience headache, nervousness, abdominal pain,  dizziness, weakness or fatigue. The drug should not be used in women who have  acute liver disease, unexplained vaginal bleeding, breast cancer or blood  clots in the legs, lungs or eyes.  The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the  drug, due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to  osteoporosis. The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this  potential effect.  Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for  contraception in many other countries. The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo, Mich.,  which will market the drug under the name, Depo Provera Contraceptive  Injection, first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s.  At that time, animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause  breast cancer. Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer,  including breast cancer in humans, to be minimal if any.                                   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993         New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses                       P92-37 Food and Drug Administration                         Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177  The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new  rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life- threatening illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease.   "These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious  illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would  otherwise be possible," said HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, M.D. "The effort  to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and  indeed a hallmark of this administration."   These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to  approve a drug based on "surrogate endpoints" or markers. They apply when the  drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. Such  endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in  themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified  scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.   Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval  earlier than if traditional endpoints -- such as relief of disease symptoms or  prevention of disability and death from the disease -- are used.   The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and  effectiveness, based on surrogate endpoints, can be reasonably established.  The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct  postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate  endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.   One new drug -- zalcitabine (also called ddC) -- was approved June 19, using a  model of this process, for treating the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, the  cause of AIDS.   Accelerated approval can also be used, if necessary, when FDA determines that  a drug, judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease, can be used  safely only under a restricted distribution plan.   "The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process  without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight," said FDA  commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. "While drug approval will be accomplished  faster, these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and  effectiveness standards required by law."

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that  certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can  prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The  degeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of  visual impairment       This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of  the National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose  their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug  treatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million  Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and  100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease  that causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo  surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas.       The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa)  Foundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye  Institute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas  Yasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge  Yancoooulos, Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an  exclusive license for this research from UCSF.      In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to  assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring  substances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week.  Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their  photoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light  exposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic  Factor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing  unwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and  Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments.       Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron's Director of  Clinical Research, said, "BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that  have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age- related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment,  and for retinal detachment. Following detachment, permanent vision loss may   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. It is possible that BDNF  could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached  surgically."       "Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the  retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases  to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope  that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression  and preserve useful vision throughout life," stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D.,  Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.       In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in  conjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for  peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy,  motor neuron diseases, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. By  itself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral  sclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease).       Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a  leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for  the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve  injuries, which affect more than seven million Americans. Drs. LaVail and  Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron.

These findings, according to  investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have  serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing  countries.       "This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and  have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the  importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body  weight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing  countries and affluent nations as well," explains principal investigator Dr.  William E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid  metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University.       Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the  food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while  simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.   These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra  Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have  coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary  heart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is  virtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name  Tarahumara means "fleet of foot," reflecting a tribal passion for betting on  "kickball" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more  while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.      The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas,  and pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water,  together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras  also eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains  approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69  percent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator  in the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while  low in cholesterol and fat.      The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL,  low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density  lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values  are in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated  cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  disease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the  Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although  able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL- cholesterol.       Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria  Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school  building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food  was weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the  investigators' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food  stipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly,  and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for  cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements  included participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.   Thirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were  fed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an "affluent" diet.       "In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40  percent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that  many Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in  fiber," elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in  the cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian  Sonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  "The CSI is a single number that  incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in  the diet.  CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol  level, particularly the LDL," Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet  averages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor's "affluent" diet used in the study  ranks a CSI of 149.       The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of  establishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before  exposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating  dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or  plateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat  and/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  "You  must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put  into the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not  discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease  because the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on  a plateau," Dr. Connor says.       After 5 weeks of consuming the "affluent" diet, the subjects' mean plasma  cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL  fraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent,  and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride  levels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in  weight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon,  yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35  days.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993       The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized  nations.  "We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount  of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic  study.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary  cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.   In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total  calories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects  the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary  cholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased  quite a bit in this study," Dr. Connor explains.      Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of  coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of  fat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because  of their usual high fat intake.       Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20  percent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI  around 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in  meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent  suggestions that Americans adopt a "Mediterranean-style" diet.  "The original  Mediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of  fat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of  meat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to  olive oil is not going to help the situation."       The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the  emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies  undergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart  disease starts with a given society's elite, who typically eat a different  diet than the average citizen.  "If the pattern of afluence increases, the  entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease,  which places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the  developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can  concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public  health measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for  unnecessary, expensive medical technology," Dr. Connors says.      "The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move  their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a  very short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary  heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years  ago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly," he concludes.

The purpose of misc.health.diabetes is to provide a forum for the discussion of issues pertaining to diabetes management, i.e.: diet, activities, medicine schedules, blood glucose control, exercise, medical breakthroughs, etc.  This group addresses the issues of management of both Type I (insulin dependent) and Type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes.  Both technical discussions and general support discussions relevant to diabetes are welcome.   2.   Postings to misc.heath.diabetes are intended to be for discussion purposes only, and are in no way to be construed as medical advice. Diabetes is a serious medical condition requiring direct supervision by a primary health care physician.     -----(end of charter)----- --  Steve Kirchoefer

CIA World Map II ---------------- [  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.   If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the   Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from   the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with   searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]    Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)   The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries   in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for   every half degree longitude and latitude.     A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).   There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and   builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask   Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.   The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.  NCAR data ---------   NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.   This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,   IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.  UNC data tapes with voxel data --------------   There are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT   scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)    The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD  NASA ----   Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data   from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,   etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following   address for more info:       National Space Science Date Center      Goddard Space Flight Center      Greenbelt, Maryland 20771      Telephone: (301) 286-6695      Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov    The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.

NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of   what's there is available at present.  Earth Sciences Data -------------------    There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including   imagery. This listing is called "Earth Sciences Resources on Internet",   and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]   in the directory COGS under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"    Some sites include:   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from         Magellan and Viking missions etc.         pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole         archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an         e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the         subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:          send SPACE Index         send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91          (Capitalization is important!

Background imagery/textures/datafiles =========================================   First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP list above.  24-bit scanning: ----------------   Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for   speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll   house supplies.   So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.  Books with textures: --------------------   Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.   Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also   a wide variety of stock art is available.   Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,   UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.    In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your   graphics work. Their address is:  Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,  00196 Rome Italy,  Piazzale Flaminio, 19  Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60  Texture Libraries: ------------------ a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit    textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit    TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.     Contact:    Mannikin Sceptre Graphics    1600 Indiana Ave.    Winter Park, FL 32789    Phone: (407) 384-9484    FAX: (407) 647-7242  b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine    by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point    versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.    Written by Steve Worley.     For more info contact:    Essence Info    Apex Software Publishing    405 El Camino Real Suite 121    Menlo Park CA 94025 USA  [ What about Texture City ?? ]  ==========================================================================  14. Introduction to rendering algorithms ========================================  a. Ray-Tracing: ---------------    I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read   some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would   suggest:    An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press      1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4   Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong   using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines   (erich@eye.com)  There's a more concise reference also:    Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: "An Introduction to Ray Tracing", in   "Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,   NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.  It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.  b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer) --------------------------  A good reference is:          _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,         McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.  c. Others: ---------- ??? [ More info is needed -- nfotis ]  ========================================================================  15. Where can I find the geometric data for the: ================================================  a. Teapot ? -----------  "Displays on Display" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe model of the teapot.  IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column "Jim Blinn's Corner" describes an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for example are used.  The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch). The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a tessellation at any specified resolution.  b. Space Shuttle ? ------------------  Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):  model1: A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)  406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.) 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex). Payload doors non-existent. Units: unknown.  Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He said there is no proprietary information associated with it.  model2: The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data  model3: The triangles' model.  This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.  Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.  model4: The NASA model.  The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers, defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:  <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>  From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions  3473 vertices. 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex). Payload doors closed. Units: inches.  Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model Proprietary info: unknown  model5: The old shuttle model.  The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.  104 vertices. 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex). Payload doors open. Units: meters.  We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.  ========================================================================  16. Image annotation software =============================  a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a   rasterfile.  b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some   image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not   sure exactly what they are.   You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.  c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)   and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert   things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.   Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu   (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)  d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).   This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.  e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.  f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and   two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based   toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,   pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed   tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).   A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for   SPARC systems is also available for ftp.    All software is the property of Columbia University and may not   be redistributed without permission.    ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of   PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging   routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.  g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the    position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen    color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many   of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest   X11 archive.  ========================================================================  17.

The Explorer   GUI allows users to build custom applications without having to write   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. Also, existing code can   be easily integrated into the Explorer environment. Explorer currently   is available now on SGI and Cray machines, but will become available on   other platforms in time. [ Bundled with every new SGI machine, as far as   I know]    See comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.    WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their   imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware   developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their   own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers   (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports   Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

This was   developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working   for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL   or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I   expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general   purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.   SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose   it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I   have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've   used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best   speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a   freebie if you want it"    "My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,   Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its   programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It   handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing   the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even   Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH   Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use   (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical   image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image   processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity   versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve   fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

The system can be distri-  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video  animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,  and  image  processing  operations.

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets    comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,    menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability    of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an    encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap    manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted   to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only    color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets    developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget    set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers    using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other    Motif widgets.    FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)    simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these   data graphically.

In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies. A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a package called "GVLware".  GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software) ===================================================  GRASS -----   (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army   Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and   remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a   Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,   although it is reported to have significant image processing   capabilities.    Feature Descriptions    I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the   internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass   Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using   scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very   user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software." A first review  of   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose   image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in   Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the   GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric   rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective   interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus   and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68    Host Configuration Requirements    If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for   satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC   under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster   environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it   easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented   in raster (grid-cell) form.    Availability    CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).    Mail regarding this site should be addressed to   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and   "tar" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John   Parks' GRASS tutorial.

Microstation Imager -------------------   Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS   software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager   sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a   heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.    Feature Description    Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.   Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).   RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.   Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering   and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,   generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.    The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle   VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available   for GIS applications.   Host Configuration Requirements    It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software   would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.  PCI ---   A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of   remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"   formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I   forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix   workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly   other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.    The "PCI software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "PCI   database" disk file.  The "Tape I/O" package is a set of utility   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape   formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the "PCI database" file;   this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can   display data from the PCI database to one or another of several   PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type   dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and   Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.   "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and   God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your   particular application/interest calls for.    Each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from   a common "parameter file" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your "default   directory."  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting   up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a   scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also   invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI   data structures (database file, parameter file).    The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle   a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the   Macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different   "interleave" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the   graphic-arts industry's "CT2T" format, would probably (I haven't tried)   handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT   YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start   over.  It's worth noting that the PCI "database" file is designed to   contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of   other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this   can go into the PCI "database").    I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX   systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific   third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to   mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would   display directly from a PCI "database" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be "overkill"   in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's   probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which   does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe   the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these   areas.  SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager) --------------------------------   Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed   for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since   been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging   Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.    Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and   IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).   Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement   (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.    The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may   require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame   buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X   for display.  MAP II ------   Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.  CLRview -------   CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit   the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.    This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the   visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,   TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.    CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)    in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

The polygons are all convex.  They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)  I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons.  This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that  simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line. Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.  The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small  number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.  Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons.    >finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source >with it.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display ==========================================================  PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software) ======================  IMDISP ------   IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,   enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS   data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions   [PC and Macs]  LabVIEW 2 ---------   LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the   "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.   Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any   Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual   instrument.    National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)   boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for   DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block   diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming   associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:   Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters   routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C   that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual   Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.    Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an   optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level   programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.    Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has   utility functions for memory management data communications and   downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for   the development of custom code.)  Ultimage Concept VI -------------------   Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual   Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.   A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory   instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.    Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and   characterization.    The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and   output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can   be imported.    Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.   Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and   morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and   shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom   modules.    A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local   intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.   The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)   data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.    The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even   hole filling.    The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.    GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494   707-579-1733  IPLab Spectrum --------------   IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by   Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user   tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far   too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool   supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a   movie command for cycling through windows.   Macintosh-based tools =====================  NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more ---------------------------------   NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the   Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results   from numerical modelling calculations.

For   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from   being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation   modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,   blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.    For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,   availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe   Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,   EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,   PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..    Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA   94039-7900 415-961-4400  ColorStudio and ImageStudio ---------------------------   ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has   more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and   therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can   easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a   variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close   hues, color range and mask.  ImageStudio: Don't know...

Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283  Digital Darkroom ----------------   The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and   editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to   select part of an image simply by "painting" it. A new polyline   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide   selections.  A brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion   of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.   This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale   images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as   powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.    Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr. Rd., Suite J San Diego, CA   92126 619-695-6956  Dimple ------   It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or   II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has   the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image   enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and   unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There   is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write   your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however   Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in   the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching   tool and it is very good for this purpose."    "Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its   development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of   other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt   language for writing "programs" for processing an image, defining   convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down   menus etc... It is unprotected software."    Process Software Solutions, PO Box 2110, Wollongong, New South Wales,   Australia. 2500. Phone 61 42 261757  Fax 61 42 264190.  Enhance -------   Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally   provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter   variations: "Laplacian, medium noise filter", etc.  Files can be saved   as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).    MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109  Image Analyst -------------   An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative   data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the   necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in   radiographs.    Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or   a disk-stored image.    Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.   Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically   generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.   Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and   position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and   Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR   video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.    There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user   defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,   the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and   other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also   supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber   software.   MIRAGE ------   It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the   Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.   It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image   processing displaying functions built in.   DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK ----------------------------   The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is   compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.   Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.  MAXEN386 --------   A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does   maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital   Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is   mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92   (an article on CCD's vs film).

Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu   (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)   Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,   VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building   the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.      This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy   data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a   synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.   There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based   graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware   functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and   can do image arithmetic, etc.     The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is   available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and   Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.      There is currently a project - "AIPS++" - underway to rewrite the   algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an   object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for   free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with   contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and   Australia to name a few.

DISIMP ------   (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in   interactive times.    Feature Description    DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and   spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the   DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image   processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of   modules.    Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and   Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and   ratioing.    Host Configuration Requirements    Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.   DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using   the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific   applications programs.    Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick   enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be   interactively driven through this control.    A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of   image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential   for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be   added to further enhance referenced imagery.    The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help   required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional   processing of remote sensed data.

Been around for   a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000   with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display"  HIPS ---- (Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)    Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil   exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well   as a huge user-contributed library.    Feature description    HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,   system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.    Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image   transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image   statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs   have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task   can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users   become effective using HIPS on their first day.    HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been   applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX   ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual   pages, and on-line documentation.    Host Configuration Requirements    Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing   environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating   system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.   HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and   Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.   For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and   Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and   Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun   console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X   windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an   interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with   users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-   Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices   because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.    Availability    HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS   is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or   Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]    MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives   workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in   256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional   GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS   formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-   dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision   and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in   assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize   the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value   value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other    palettes can be generated.   Supported functions include such niceties as the following:  o  image & image: + - / * interpolation o  image & constant: + - / * o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,    byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short. o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or    without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section. o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,    line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp    masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,    line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to    any specified angle. o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan    bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to    region target mean, median, or modal value. o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,    collapse 2-d image into 1-d image. o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of    region of an image. o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot    keyword values for a set of images. o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,    brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower    luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive    background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical    aperture shape to image isophotes.  o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot    of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`    centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,    change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and    adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function    or histogram equalization. o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for    registration. o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or    2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers    can be cycled through.

ss we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image. >This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images. > >Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications >in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image, >we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations. > Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8 bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a 32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.  Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?  Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range 0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.  You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look rather odd.  So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:  >>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>much more complicated.  >>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much >>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.  In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job. Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.  As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If that was not what you meant, then:  >(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many >places so far.)  Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was.

Point 1:  I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole "yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon", necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully cognizant of since I, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  For the situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word, and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic". It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional "difficult" patient.  Point 2:  I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non- therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from a treatment point-of-view.  And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/ science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the patient should come first when considering treatment.  What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence) for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them.  This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.  Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to why I am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure "scientific" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and by the "scientific" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho. Just my 'NF' leanings, I guess.  :^)  Comments?  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among  21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This  report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital  Discharge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.       Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been  collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC's National Center  for Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were  abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484  participating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior  cesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national  estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged  after delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were  calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from  national vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of  cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based  solely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at  the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value  of 1.96.       In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as  in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean  rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no  previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.  In 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05)  higher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast  (22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years  than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or  government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger  hospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other  private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of  payment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.       Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women  increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained  the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3,  essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.       Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated  338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary  cesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been  performed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean  delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991,  35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e.,  failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal  distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications.       The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In  comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days,  and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC  deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3  days). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for  primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and  non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively.   Reported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center  for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from  1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates  have been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that  maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because  cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of  childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the  overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary  cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).       Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections  -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries  than for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for  cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in  1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and  $4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes  $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean  rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number  of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000),  resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital  charges.       Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may  impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean  delivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women  offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).  Of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7)  --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely  offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  national data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data)  was 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all  women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was  attempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the  VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary  rate.       One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by  applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean  delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review  process (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates  include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing  reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of  physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public  awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns,  which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean  delivery (4).

Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U.S. citizens and their dependents  stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and  unpredictably. During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of  State (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases  among official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the  health records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27  cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June  1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and  CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and  identify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This  report summarizes the results of the investigation.       Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were  available for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if  the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide- confirmed as having malaria.       A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to  obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria  chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets  and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long  sleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey,  128 (82%) responded.       Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in  Kampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less  than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15  years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk  RR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the  cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years,  compared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the  Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for  malaria.       Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who  participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine  alone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were  not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly  lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88  9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37  24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported  side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.       The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely  used bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was  also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening  (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0;  upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with  failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the  evening.       As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel  the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection  measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to  provide window and door screens for all personnel.   Reported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical  Svcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases,  National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.   Editorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was  attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis  regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased  malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan  Africa. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and  continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in  malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for  short-term travelers to such areas.       Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most  other areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas  (e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In  Africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in  preventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and  well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk  for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis  (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000  users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness,  gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for  other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).       Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need  for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen  (3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense  chloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for  persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil  is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be  used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P.  falciparum has not been reported.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and  pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the  United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than  90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these  organisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely  recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined  vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate  injections.       The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products  for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for  vaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine  (TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in  vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease.                                  ActHIB Trademark        On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T),  manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB  Trademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This  vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary  vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously  unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months  apart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one  dose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all  children. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive  a single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving  a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4,  and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b  polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to  that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in  prospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early  because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  for use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease  were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and  other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to  that of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark       On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus  toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl  River, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL  Registered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and  Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis  Biologics, Inc. Rochester, New York).       This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years  for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when  indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate  vaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody  responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark  is expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus,  and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other  DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines.       The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that  all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b  conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12- 15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose  primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2,  4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A  complete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and  TETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed.

The workshop was organized by Dr. John Greenspan and Dr. Deborah  Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology, School of Dentistry, University of  California, San Francisco.  An international steering committee and scientific  program committee provided guidance.       The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including  Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United  States and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National  Institute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research,  and the Procter and Gamble Company.       Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics,  professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision  of oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and  mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and  women's issues.                                   Recommendations       Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association  between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to  establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for  more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology  studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral  lesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions.                                    Epidemiology       Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV  Infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  radically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely  in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.   Today, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in  children and adolescents.       While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a  major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.   Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more  are appearing all the time.       Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions  such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore  the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression  and prognosis.                               Social/political Issues       Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection  focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for  indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health  care delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public  about what AIDS is, and how it is acquired.                             Saliva and Salivary Glands       Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory  activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary  secretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular  secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid  secretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible  for salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect  of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both  promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2)  direct effects on the virus or target cells.       Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease  in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.                                  Pediatric Issues       Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With  early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV- infected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from  mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's  sero-status is known prior to giving birth.                       Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993       Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and  gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at  the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of  diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration  of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.                          Occupational and Treatment Issues       Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals  and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command  considerable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit  of HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection  and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the  treatment of HIV-infected patients.       Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on  the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.   Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence  Company in late 1993.              
r support and the separation of text and image.     The following is the relevant sections from the man page.     -----------------------------------------------------------------  Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)  NAME    bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations  DESCRIPTION   bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on   Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both   24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.    As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their   original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the   many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using   mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The   SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed   in full without being limited by the window or screen size.    As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and   processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss   at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing   subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type   whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of   input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into   another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple   geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with   the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take   advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).    Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing   image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence   turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be   accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image   will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-   nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically   giving great flexibility in processing an image.  FEATURES    Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a   continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete,    the processed image will be displayed.    Current features include    o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing     and filling the "rotated out" region with an arbitrary color.    o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with     the option of subpixel sampling.    o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an     image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving     the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to     take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text     strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as     in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha     followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.    o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.    o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation     function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary     forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels     separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of     it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished     rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-     lability of graphical histograms of the image.    o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-     gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at     arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some     user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering     directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,     PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions     independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a     circle).    o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-     to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.    o Performs histogram equalization.    o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of     arbitrary order.    o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.    o Cuts and pastes across images.    o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.    o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause     interval between images. (SlideShow)    o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels     along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities     or as an intensity vs. distance plot.    o Performs image type conversions.    o Converts image formats.    o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).    o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image     back and display it.    o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.    o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the     resulting power spectra.    o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

Omidvar         Minsoo Suk                  Series Editor        Volume Editor    Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing Corporation is planning a special volume on "Shape Analysis", scheduled for this year.  This volume will be a part of "Progress in Neural Networks," an annual book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.  Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling, shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching, surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.  The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably, but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below) an  abstract and an outline to msuk@ima.enst.fr by May 30, 1993.

cracker" ethic, which is something entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks, crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the 286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.      That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.    I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists, where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves "hackers" allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative, interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry?    I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.  +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  "Revenge is a dish best served co
est example of where U.S. medicine is really missing the  mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is PMS.  So many women(and  their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that  most physicians in the U.S. are not taught that PMS is primarily caused by  diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening.  Before shooting  your flames, read the entire article and then decide if flaming is  justified.  From A Poster In Sci. Medi. Nutrition: >  In a psychological anthropology course I am taking, we got  > sidetracked onto a short conversation about PMS.  Some rumors shared > by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels, sugar > intake, and caffeine intake might affect PMS symptoms. >  Is there any data on this, or is it just so much hooey? >  > Many thanks, >  > Michael, I've wanted to reply to this post ever since I saw it but I got  side-tracked with candida.  PMS is a lot like Candida blooms, most  physicians don't recognize it as a specific "disease" entity.  Here is  everything that you would ever want to know about PMS.  Premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:   PMT-A(Anxiety)  PMT-D(depression)  anxiety   depression  irritability  forgetfulness  insomnia  confusion  depression  lethargy   PMT-C(Craving)  PMT-H(Hyperhydration)  craving for sweets weight gain  increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness  sugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness   1. headache  edema of the face and extremities   2. palpitations   3. fatigue or fainting   PMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low  progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women's cycle.  PMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple  carbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women's cycle, there is  increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose  challenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are  a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia  is not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of  hypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.  A. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990). Unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium  supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of  the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources  of alpha linoleic acid.  PMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase of a women's cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead  toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal  phase). "Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human  endometrial cystol" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).  PMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated  serum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E  for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H  This general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:   A.

Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)  Treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can  find a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one  that will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work,  supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really  has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida  blooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental  controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to  see done).  Here are a few of these studies:   CARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, "Effect of a low-fat,   high-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy" Lancet   2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy   of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive   specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories   and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary   advise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant   reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in   the trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as   physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling,   tenderness and nodularity.   VITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, "The use of Vitamin A in   premenstrual tension" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).    218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU   vitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored   and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of   toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the   study was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool   size(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this   normal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose   vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10%   getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.    10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS   symptoms.   Experimental Controlled Study, "Premenstrual tension treated with   vitamin A" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts   received 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their   cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.    After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in   PMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of   toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year   after high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms   did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the   vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  Most Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.   These studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal  store of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins  given for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best  single effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid  (estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full  of vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent  the symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don't want to be trying  to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin  A toxicity.   VITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, "Pyridoxine  (vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover   trial"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49   with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.    After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another   3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of   PMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS   were not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.   Experimental Double-blind Study, "The efects of vitamin B6   supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms" Obstet. Gynecol   70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received   150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence   showed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related   to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as   behavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)    Anxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6   supplementation.  Vitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control  pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.   Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per  day.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R.  Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in  Clin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be  considered the "first-line" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the  patient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin  B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each  day.     VITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Efficacy of alpha-  tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome" J. Reprod.   Med. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3   cycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a   significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast   tenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant   reduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38%   had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo   group.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant  decrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.   Experimental Double-blind Study, "The effect of alpha-tocopherol on   premenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study" J. Am. Coll. Nutr.   2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly   received vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After   2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly   improved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly   improve PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H  (other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve   PMT-H symptoms).    MAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, "Magnesium prophylaxis   of menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium" Headache   31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg   daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a   placebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and   continued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index   was significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment   was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual   Distress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in    lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower   in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer   from PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised   into the normal range.   Experimental Double-blind Study, "Oral Magnesium successfully   relieves premenstrual mood changes" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991).   32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid   360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the   onset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received   magnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster   pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the   magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were   switched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on   the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by   magnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium   supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes   that occur during PMS.  There are numerous observational studies that have been published in the  medical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder  that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But  since observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med.  to be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are  also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on  multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I've chosen the  best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out  that PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don't recognize  nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri,  pellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor  being trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS  is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional  disorders.  It's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.  Here's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral  supplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.   Experimental Study, "Effect of a nutritional programme on   premenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis", Complement. Med.   Res.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and   supplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E,   magnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to   take the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate   diet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an   improvement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that   they no longer suffered from PMS.     Experimental Double-blind Study, "Role of Nutrition in managing   premenstrual tension syndromes", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).    A low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite   supplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet   change and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the   vitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased   estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel   phase of their cycle.   Experimental Double-blind Study, "Clinical and biochemical effects   of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome", J.   Reprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12   tablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a   significant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another   group of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this   second group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on   PMS symptoms was observed.

But before I do, I want to  get a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney  stone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart  disease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to  encourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do  most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from  the truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to  be ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance. Same thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have  a problem with one of these diseases, don't use what I'm going to tell you  or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go. Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help  you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment  program(but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here).  When  my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say, don't worry my vitamin  E will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician,  plan and simple.  If it's begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet  change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring. But let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation  and another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as  your little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a  regular basis, my wife kept putting her's off, both myself and her  gynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even  scheduled one, but she didn't show up(too busy running the Operating Room for  the biggest Hospital in Tulsa).  One more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses  high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is  absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have  drug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is  really blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and  minerals are being used.  I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't  be right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a  lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D's who wrote the new  Clinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab  tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet  changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you  handle stress.  That's where I'm coming from folks.  Blast away if you want, I'm not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really  don't care.  I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think  that I've got something important to say.  But I'm also getting hit by a  few with an axe to grind.  That's life.  Chromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very  important) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor (GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine  and glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to  form GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast, and black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is  seen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral  chelate(chromium picolinate) it's absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest  for all the minerals).  I've been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has  come up there several times as a "fat burner".  Chromium is among the least  toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really  do any harm.  I wouldn't do it though.  The adequate and safe range for  chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about  30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many  believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I  can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in  Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one, there  also seems to be a negative one as well.  I'm convinced that the problem is  bioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when  chromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to  Type II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and  glucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is  concerned  Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease,  this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising.  Glucoma is a little  more interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin  responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity  is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular  pressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with  glaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll.  Nutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt  people to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing,  just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless  they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often  found in older people, it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the  RBC's.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would  prompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to  check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.  You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC  chromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a  RBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail  analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.  There is just too much funny  business going on in these unregulated labs right now.  Here's Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider  chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is  available(they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they  also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not  routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change  and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical  response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium  supplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of  CrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.  What's my advise?  Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight (they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then  exercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most  Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have  a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.   When he or she says, "what in the world are you talking about", just 
s bloody war, he considers himself a surgeon.     ``Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice. But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''     Evacuated by the U.N. this week to his home town of Tuzla, the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there.     ``I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica. All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce,'' he told reporters.     Mujanovic, 31, had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla, but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own. Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times, relying on books for guidance, amputating arms and legs 150 times, usually without anesthetic, delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections.     He worked 18-to-19-hour days, slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug. 5 and treated  4,000 patients.     He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla, 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica. About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain, he said.     His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field, killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. Half of the dead were women and children.     The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer. ``There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street,'' he said.     ``There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together. One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead. They had no heads.''     Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable, he said. Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools, facilities and medicine.     The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs.''     Once he arrived the situation improved, he said, but by mid-September he had run out of supplies.     ``Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands,'' he said. Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding.     ``People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations,'' he said. Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.     ``I felt destroyed psychologically,'' Mujanovic said.     The situation improved after Dec. 4, when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres.     But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region. ``Every day we had air strikes and shellings.''     Then the hunger set in.     Between mid-December and mid-March, when U.S. planes began air dropping food, between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition, he said.     ``I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation,'' he said.     According to Mujanovic, around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica, 1,000 of them children, during a year of siege.     Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife, who is i

PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).  I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures, hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)  The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize "stitching" artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed. Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid.  Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate- mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.  This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair "backwards" (i.e. smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.  I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer, typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers). Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching.  But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003 to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines "show through" areas which they are supposed to lie behind.  I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation; this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX 5.1.  Open questions:     (1) Why does this happen?         --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?         --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines             as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which             could be corrected for?         --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their             interpolators?         --  Something else?     (2) What to do about it?         --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision             in Z-buffered HLHSR?         --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching             artifacts?         --  Am I just out of luck?  Any help would be immensely appreciated!  --  ==============================================================
rn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular, if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food, food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. This results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction. Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying, and causes frequent discomfort.  My doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so, was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this, especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation, reaction to anesthesia).  The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number of "extra" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24 hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this, however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was "normal". It certainly doesn't feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something as simple as climbing some stairs).

Gee, I have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself, my friends, and my family, but in the practice of medicine I expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than "Aunt Susie's brother-in-law ...".

Candida can do that to you. :-)  Gordon, I think that the best clinical  trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal  candida blooms L. Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the  frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the  candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus  should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the  intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to  oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the  lay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I'm really  amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.   The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all  conventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if  conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard  medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?

But colonic flushes are not the  way to improve gut function.  Each person has almost a unique mix of  bacteria in his/her gut.  Diet affects this mix as does the use of  antibiotics.  A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in  your gut than is colonic flushes.  Cross contamination has been a real  problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment  is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments". Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've  picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his  instruments(more clostly but much safer).  Full sterile technique is  also used just like that practiced in an OR(mask, gloves and gowns worn and  disposed of between patients).  Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than  the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket.  His much  higher fees do not drive away patients.  I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to  this colonic flush procedure.

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical, biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.  Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,  bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.   CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it.

Graeme Gill.  ########################################################################### "A note on gamma correction and images"  Author: Graeme W. Gill         graeme@labtam.oz.au  Date: 93/5/16   "What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?" --------------------------------------  Although it would be nice to think that "an image is an image", there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some look too light. "Why is this ?" you may ask. This, is gamma correction (or the lack of it).  Why do we need gamma correction at all ? --------------------------------------  Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene, then you have created a "linear" or un-gamma-corrected image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world). Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this:  Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma  So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to "gamma correct" the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get what you want. So you have to do this to your image:  gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)  For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.  If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ? -----------------------------------------------------  The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction. Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are  rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular CRT.  Whose fault is all this ? -----------------------  It is really three things. One is all those display programs out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is. The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying gamma's.  At least two file formats do the right thing. The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression) specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).  Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility) allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has, and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.  [ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends to give a tint to the image. ]  How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ? ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg (provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a bit.)  If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness will be above the center.  If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be around 2.2   [with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the -dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA environment variable in your .profile]  How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ? -------------------------------------------------  This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of 1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images (ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected to some degree or other.  If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.  If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.  Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing -----------------------------------------------------  One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium. This is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic. This means images  could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance), if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level.  If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma, and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data, then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

eo Graphics Accelerator          SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces  WINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that  delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the  competition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high  refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.   The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local  bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).         With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers  maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate  of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768  non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater  than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video  standards.         WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology,  which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more  comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility  developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen  and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.         WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed  offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards  will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will  transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is  also offering this card in the "TurboBahn" combination packaged  with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.         Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator,  WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance  value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge"  the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with  power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced  chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and  reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D  Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.

Is there another newsgroup that                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A >  might have specifics on herbal remedies? A >  A >  Robert Allison   I tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,  so I'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.    Rutin is NOT a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. You should  generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid   complex instead. If you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)  you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other  major component of the bioflavonoid complex.  I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it  showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-  fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in   hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids   to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.  Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so  there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole  bioflavonoid complex instead.   I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that   they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose   bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...  One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day  for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.     They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can  be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are  made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.   About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency,   with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.  For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.    In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they  are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine   bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite  small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times  higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark  extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.  The name for the pine bark product is 'Pycnogenol.'       Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:      Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable    Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing     Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable      SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing      Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!     -- Ron Roth --  =====================================================================  --  I

The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by anonymous FTP indefinitely.       The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine & Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit, but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items omitted later in the planning process.       This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word, theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local computer support person.

l photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.  -- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --  This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as a group.  -- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --  Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.  You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!  -- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --  To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain  Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining.  Expect a "welcome" message within 5 days after you send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!  -- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --  Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the following address:          lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com  Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address.  NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.  -- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --  Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up:          lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com  In the body of the message enter:  unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain  I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you.   -- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --  I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates.  If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>  I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please send a mail message to:          fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com  The first command to the server must be "HELP" or "USER name <passwd>".  Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile. Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service. Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.    -- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --  Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to the list.  Every little bit helps.  Qu
port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or  keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR  gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and  others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications  such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality,  Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more  can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts  Plug and Play on every PC.  The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of  systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host  computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a  number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software  development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross- platform use of the same device.  ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION: =====================================  ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone  to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without  fee or royalty. ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single  host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus  data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.  ACCESS.bus Physical Layer ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware  protocol, with one data line and one clock line. Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level  handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock  synchronization.    ACCESS.bus Software Protocols ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three  levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.  I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines  arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C  provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with  different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing,  framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the  receiver.    BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between  a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the  ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an  ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with  additional semantics, including checksum. Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot  plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus  addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot  plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the  system is running, without rebooting.  APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus  protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular  types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application  Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified:  keyboards, locators, and text devices.  ACCESS.bus support on the PC ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the  PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the  base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.   An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1  - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with  the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for  multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and  Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples  of the interface from applications to the devic
 thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines (not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive algorithm that would let you step in and say "no, dummy, you're going the wrong way".   Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii). A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles. This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with its auto-trace tool.   In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight, clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult this problem is to solve in the general case.   (*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have 
orm that would >emulate the effects of red/green colour blindness? I have had >a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results. >Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?   Certainly. Reference follows.   Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.  The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina. It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected.  Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.  On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31  Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.  So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?  This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.  *So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or duuteranopia:  1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram 2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point 3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line 4) This is the new chromaticity.   The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications 8(5) 28-40.  You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.  >I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow >previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour >blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!  Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a couple of weeks ago.  The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a help here.)  A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you have the monitor data. B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v' using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z) C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above D) find the intersection as in step 3 E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and white) until it is displayable.  >Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is >sufficient interest  Done; also posted for the rest of us.  -- Chris Lilley ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Technical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project Computer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxf

We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit, and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.  So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway, and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such problems to my programs in the first place.  Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image back to 24 bit image.   >>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How >>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global >>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and >>>much more complicated.  Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way, jumps off the discussion a bit.  My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.   About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image: changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image. XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the mentioned type images.  Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like paint program job. If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area -- selecting individual color is possible from that.  Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...   >Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not designed for that. Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say, person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work -- design error.  I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making major change to the original design.  So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes up, and put a note on this design 
 again in the future.  In article <123552@netnews.upenn.edu>, lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Lida Chaplynsky) writes: >  > A family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on > by menopause as well as a mental break down.

Both my wife and I suffered from  bouts of depression.  Her's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a  rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and  chemotherapy.  Lida, I used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through  her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist).  When  severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped, I tried to  use supplements to bring her out of it.  I had "cured" her PMS using  supplements and I really thought that I knew enough about the role of diet  in depression to take care of her depression as well.  It didn't work and  she was put on Prozac by her oncologist.  Two Winters ago(three years after  by wife's breast cancer) I got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and  one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another  stressor).  I tried to take care of it for several months with  supplementation.  Didn't work.  My internist ended up putting me on Prozac.  I was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using  B6, niacin, folate and B12 to "cure" depression.  I'm not going to do that  because all you would be doing is flying blind like I was.  Lida, I do believe that depression can have a dietary component.  But the  problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use  an approach which will "fix" the problem.  For chemotherapy, I knew exactly  what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be  affected.  Same thing for PMS.  I was flying blind for both of these  stressors but the literature that I used to devise a treatment program was  pretty good.  Depression is just too complicated.  What you really need is  a nutritional scan.  This is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your  bodies nutrient reserves.  For every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin C),  you have a reserve.  The RDA is not designed to give you enough of any  nutrient to keep these reserves full, it is only designed to keep them from  being emptied which would cause clinical pathology.  Stress will increase  your need for many vitamins and minerals.  This is when your reserves become  very important.  Lida, without your permission, I'm going to use your post as a conduit to  try to explain to the readers in this group and Sci. Med. where I'm coming  from.  I have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the Osteopathic  Medical schools for ten years now.  I've written my own textbook because  none was available.  What I teach is not a rehash of biochemistry.  I  preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by  my students as sermons).  Here is what I cover:  Indroduction and Carbohydrates    Lipids  Proteins I     Proteins II  Energy Balance     Evaluation of Nutritional       Status I, A Clinical        Perspective  Evaluation of Nutritional Status II,            Evaluation of Nutritional   A Biochemical Perspective   Status III, Homework        Assignment Using the        Nutritionist IV Diet and        Fitness Analysis Software        program  Weight Control     Food Fads and Facts  Age-Related Change in Nutrient Requirements Food Additives,        Contaminants and Cancer  Drug-Nutrient Interactions   Mineral and Water Balance  Sodium, Potassium and Chloride   Calcium, Magnesium and        Phosphorus  Iron      Zinc and Copper  Iodine and Fluoride    Other Trace Minerals  Vitamin A     Vitamin E  Vitamins D and K    Vitamin C  Thiamin and Niacin    Riboflavin and Pyridoxine  Pantothenic and Folic acids   Biotin and B12  Other Nutrient Factors    Enteral Nutrition  Parenteral Nutrition  Every three years I spend my entire Summer reviewing the Medical literature  to find material that I can use in my nutrition textbook.  I last did this  in the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down  and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books  that have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which  I write myself) I've pulled figures, tables and graphs from various  copyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for  educational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not  send this material out to newsgroup readers(as I've been asked to do).  I am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition  assessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need  to make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the  nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to  be required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to  design supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment  Centers of America, which is a private for-profit organization with  hospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a  nutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin  Clinic in California has a similiar lab setup.  For physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new  Clinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I  have been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown  series book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more  to residency training.  Two M.D's have written this new Clinical Nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it  does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a  patient's nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the  Preface of this new text:  "So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists,  hematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge  of nutrition as it related to their field of practice."    "Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United  States require no formal instruction in nutrition."  "But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the  leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related."  "... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it  should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of  nutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your  awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important  for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially  every organ system."  Roland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH   Lida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find  a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals (yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and  who could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when  women suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are  occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A  nutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned  that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red  cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium  reserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to  try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are  also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral  analysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using  certified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some  pretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone  who will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are  using a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Act).    A diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown  to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging  and software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But  there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not  show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status. Until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the  U.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional  profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses  diet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue  to be the best approach to depression.

I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.  ____________________________________________________________________________ [Reprinted w/o permission]   "There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries"  By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services        On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings  is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.      It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called  Families USA.       The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe  that doctors make too much money.      The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for  physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be  OK.      How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.      Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment  and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign  and are still simmering.      You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that  earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority  of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who  do are stealing it from them.      Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.   Karl Marx lives.      It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such  as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to  become a physician?      If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should  have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they  should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much  a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a  doctor?      Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "How  much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent  grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order  to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking  courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and  maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years  of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth  years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and  (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)  put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,  depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in  debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60  hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or  more until they retire or fall over?"      As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably  more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and  Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have  called together to remake America's health care.      Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far  more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,  social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is  to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.      But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,  many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the  major cause of high medical costs.      Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.   Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for  our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in  a McDonald's?      And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become  a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch  cabbages.      Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or  Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But  instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,  they might have been more honest if they had said:      "Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest  problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,  you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you  guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;  getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the  microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into  the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot  victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease  while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.      "You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single  biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is  amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.      "In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at  your blubbery bods all day.      "So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and  start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy- greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do."      But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,  there is another solution: Don't use them.      That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those  spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands  upon your head and declare you fit.      Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest  pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit  there, and pop in a couple of valves.      You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that  overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house  than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and  malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?      Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.   And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on  how to give it its shots.      By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much  pollsters should earn?   Royko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  T

Except for ones caused by infections, the treatment is generally thyroxin pills. Hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does...this doesn't sound like the case with your wife. Thyroxin orally does "shut down the thyroid" through a feedback loop involving the pituitary (I believe). The pituitary "thinks" that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn't have to tell the thyroid to produce more. This process is reversable! I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested I not take the pills for 6 wks. When I was retested for thyroxin levels, they were normal. I still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear. The pills are safe and have very few side-affects (& those mostly at beginning of treatment). Having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels. Thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness, coldness, and weight gain. There is also water retention (possibly around heart), changes in vision, and coarser hair and skin among other things.

L.  acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily  responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of  the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.  bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are  much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told  me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several  different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't  told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative  anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a  chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria  around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal  region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida  blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from  the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do  believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower  colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the  competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked. Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get  rid of the problem.  Ant
 and Sutherlands Freedom graphics subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have  similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market penetration.  There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features, however, will remain much more flexible.  The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system. Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade them separately as needed.  Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications. Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels to obtain better texturing performance.  K

There are quacks who don't treat and quacks who treat. One's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.  There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. Smart quacks and dumb ones.   There are people ahead of their time, with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals. There are ill-reasoned, absurd, theorists.   Sometimes it's hard to tell who's who.    Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in Babylon.   Arguments abound when there aren't any firm answers. Plenty of illnesses aren't, or can't, be diagnosed or treated. But I think it's better to argue against the theory, as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago. Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone's competency. And you can't convince everybody.   Sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people: they don't run into a doctor who recognizes the disease, they haven't developed something recognizable yet, or they have something that no one is going to recognize, because it hasn't been described yet. Sometimes they get a cure, sometimes the illness wears out, sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment, sometimes th

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's hard to digest anyway.   For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses  your middle. Be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it will put pressure on the digestive tract.   Try laying on your sides, back, and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive. Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby "turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months. When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.   Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young.  But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible.   Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and

Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out >in SCI.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the  >existence of systemic yeast syndrome?  I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist. No scientist would take your statement --- "no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome" --- to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out the catch-22 that if the "crazy" theory were true, you probably couldn't find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences --- namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals, many of them appear to get better.    So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example, controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative.    And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people have been talking about.  But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus, it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind study of antifungals (or else, forget convinci

Second, the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet. If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that they do now.    >For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or >rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn.

If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the baby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. Also, I don't think the surgery lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )   >Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with

I have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from  local newspapers, magazines, to TV-guide, with disclaimers on the  bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us  compliments of the Dairy Industries.  There are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive  financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous   benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.   Secondly, were ALL the kidney stones of the test subjects involved   in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  The study  didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large-  ly calcium."  Perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact  opposite findings. A curious phenomenon with researchers is that they  are oftentimes just plain wrong. It wouldn't be the first time.    Sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still   the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention   of kidney stones.  I, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in  one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney  stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an INCREASE  in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium  type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit  from a PHOSPHORUS-raising approach instead!

EEE  and  SIG-           GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-           tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was           represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS           users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-           dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and           academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS           users  to  "take  charge of your PHIGS" by participating in PHIGS           standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS           implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond           PHIGS".            Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following           topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,           Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented           Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS           Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and           Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed           a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-           ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools           based on PHIGS.            Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.            PHIGS EVERYWHERE            At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated           PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to           mainframes.            Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including           conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing           and translucency.            Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-           Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add           advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like           ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.           Radiosity support is also planned.            FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging           graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate           mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase           and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.            TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful           "2-call"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-           oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.            G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on           Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-           sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-           tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS           developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS           internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data           Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described           their application GSE that allows application callback  functions           during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-           izer and application development toolkit, are currently available           on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or           Starbase.            Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows           and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most           of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many           advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-           tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS           or ARENA is available on request.            ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-           tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most           workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-           porates PEX support.            Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital           Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the           DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.           DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with           support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most           GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as           proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and           the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340           workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.            Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A           Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics           PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-           ments.             PHIGS USER GROUP            The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS           applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and           PHIGS standards bodies.

Also, users can send the authors feedback, to report text errors and software bugs, make suggestions, and submit exercises.  To receive information describing how you can use the mail handler, simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu and put the word "Help" in the Subject line.  Use the Subject line "Software-Distribution" to receive information specifically concerning the software packages SRGP and SPHIGS.  Errata for "An Introduction to Ray Tracing" is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books/IntroToRT.errata.  Errata for "Digital Image Warping" is in the same directory as "Digital-Image-Warping.errata".  All C code from the "Graphics Gems" series is available via anonymous ftp from princeton.edu.  Look in the directory pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems for the various volumes (Gems, GemsII, GemsIII), and get the README file first.  Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books.  A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.   2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.  The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:  The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes "Computer Graphics" book is certainly a good start.  Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", then read chapter 15, "Visible-Surface Determination".  For more information go to chapter 16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.   3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.  Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).  A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293.  Note that the code from the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site, as described above.  Check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual.  The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as "doing a better job than the other algorithms, but slower".  There's also an implementation of:  Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988), pp. 153-162.  avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code, in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.   4) Converting color into grayscale.  The NTSC formula is:      luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue   5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.  The only reference you need for this stuff is:      Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6  But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.   6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.  The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling.  However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included, which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: "A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears in "Graphics Gems" (see section [1]) under the original title.   7) Free image manipulation software.  There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions. Here are pointers to some of them:      xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format     conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing     of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file     contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

You may find useful information there.   8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.  You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.  These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct. This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.  A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently, neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.  FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.    9) Converting between vector formats.  A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.  There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac. A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.  On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation, rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another. As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive site.  A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial.  GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2).   10) How to get Pixar films.  The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:      Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price     Luxo, Jr.    $14.95   $50.00     Red's Dream    $19.95   $75.00     Tin Toy    $24.95   $75.00     Knickknack    $24.95   $75.00     Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy $39.95   $100.00  All tapes are on 1/2" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also available:      Tin Toy T-shirt   $15.00     Knickknack 3D T-shirt  $15.00 (includes glasses)  For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add $3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international, 213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify prices and availability.  Or, just write to:      Direct Cinema Limited     1749 14th Street     Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342  Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:  At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).      Pixar     1001 West Cutting Blvd.     Richmond, CA. 94804     (510) 236-4000      (510) 236-0388 (FAX)  You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains "Luxo, Jr.", "Red's Dream", "Tin Toy" and "Knicknack" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I  ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect  to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.   11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?  The short answer is, "You can't."  Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable, but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to do the job right, consult the article:    "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles"   by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller   in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,   September, 1989, pages 48-56.  For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:    Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture   by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,   Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.  For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:    "Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves"   by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken   in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),   June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]   12) How to order standards documents.  The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900, mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the complete name and number.  Some useful numbers to know:  CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers; for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.  Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179.   13) How to FTP by email.  There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.  In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.   14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.  Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way, the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including treatment of special cases.  Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.  Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.   15) How to tessellate a sphere.  One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.  16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.  Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:  Highlights of this edition-      i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through        November '91;     ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG         International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;     iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;     iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;     v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.  The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long. Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named "speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z" and is compressed at most sites-               Site                             Dir  wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/  karazm.math.uh.edu pub/Graphics/  gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub/papers/  nic.funet.fi  pub/sci/papers/graphics  coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/  Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination bibliographies.  These are in "refer" format, and so can be searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as "RayBib.*" and "RadBib.*".  Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This collection is available at most of the sites above as "rtabs.*".  17) SIGGRAPH information online  [from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]  ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org (128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.  The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories.  To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to      archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with the command      send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.   18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available  [from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]  ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available in three formats:      text   (ASCII)      rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)      word   (MS Word for the Macintosh) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:  (1) by anonymous ftp     change to one of the directories        publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]     The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word     files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary      mode.      Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the     contents of each panel file.  (2) by electronic mail     send mail to        archive-server@siggraph.org     You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you     first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages        send panel91-txt index        send panel91-rtf index     in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary     information to retrieve the actual transcript files.   19) Graphics mailing lists  There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing.  Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added.

Comments - 26 formats, no software       (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).       Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.   21) What about GIF?  GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.  Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,  alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,  alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers  Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:  /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 /pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of:  send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2  Send a message containing "help" to get general information about the mail server.  Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and 20 above for more information.   22) What is morphing?  Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:          morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)         morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)         m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)  The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards.   23) How to ray-trace height fields  Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.  The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:  F. Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July, 1988 <musg88.ps.Z>  This is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale University, it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:      nic.funet.fi  pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z     weedeater.math.yale.edu pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     princeton.edu  pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z     coral.cs.jcu.edu.au  graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z     gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z  An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.  Another paper exists:  %A David W. Paglieroni %A Sidney M. Petersen %T Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing %J Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92 %I Canadian Information Processing Society %C Toronto, Ontario %D May 1992 %P 192-200  And still one more:  Musgrave, Kolb, and Mace "The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains", Computer Graphics Vol 23, No. 3 (SIGGRAPH '89 procedings) p. 41-50    24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon   The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),       area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -              ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );  and the area of a planar polygon is given by       area = 0.0;       for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )          area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );      area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );      area /= 2.0;  If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.  >From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), "Area  of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:"  The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is given by       Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |  where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal to P0.   25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH  Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM. Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank. Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00, Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)  SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or Associate Members.  If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you $59.00 (no student discount).  There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.  ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.  Their phone number is (212) 626-0500.  FAX number (212) 944-1318.

Gordon Rubenfeld did a Medline  search and also sent me the same reference through e-mail.  Since  commercial yogurt does not always have a good Lactobacillus a. or  bulgaricus culture, a negative finding would not have been too informative. This is often the reason why Lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are  recommended rather than yogurt.  I guess the next question is why would this introduction of "good" bacteria  back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the  anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that Gordon R. vehementy denys)?  I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a  facultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and  colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain  the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion  was stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the  intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida  looses it's major food source.  Getting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is  normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal  yeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has  been used to get this effect but I've not seen any such treatment reported in  the medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting  their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their  patients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if  ever published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age  emerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the  medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to  help patients or does it look the other way.  This particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous  therapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But  there are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty  hot and somebody could get burned.  It's really tough.  Do I follow only  well established protocols and then give up if they don't work that well or  do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn't been proven to  work yet?  My stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they  involve little or no risk to th

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE  I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.  UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.  > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up, I am just > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it > might seem.    Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products. And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge) - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg - and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so I can either throw it out or give it away.)  > From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee)  > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG,   Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.    I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the Chinese restaurants the day before.    > From: kelley@healthy.uwaterloo.ca (Catherine L.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG - some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test. Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ chips ;}).  > From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle)  > Because too many of you (generic rhetorical 'you,' not 'you Cathy') go > around calling this "Chinese restaurant syndrome," thus suggesting to the > people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food.  > MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese food--thats why I > suggested calling this "Diner syndrome."    Cathy doesn't - I haven't saved all my postings but I NEVER called it "chinese restaurant syndrome" and I NEVER stated I got it only from Chinese food.  I just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a Chinese take out place that I knew would hold (or not hold) the MSG.  I can't call up whoever makes Doritos and ask them to make me ONE back of chips without MSG.  > On the other hand, if one complains about potatoes from a mix, or > restaurant spice mixes, I'm going to believe them, and if anyone says they > got (MSG-)sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party, I'm > REALLY going to believe them.

bership in the ACM last night, and was I ever grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!  For example:   SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same  thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the  annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,  which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the  proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.   TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.   Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI  membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,  these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic  rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.   SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the  Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to  be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG  also has doubled its membership fee.  What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple, like SIGGRAPH, all the "plus" services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31% increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31% inflation rate on the publications I got last year.  Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am? ________________________________________________________________________________ Robert Reed   Home Animation Ltd.  503-656-8414 robert@slipknot.rain.com 5686 First Court, West Linn, OR 97068  SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS  Motif:  You spend days writing a UIL description of your
ld be appreciated. >Thanks.  You've asked a toughie of a question.  There are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy.  The overall purpose of chemotherapy (don't worry about the spelling.  Some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell! :-) is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing.  Different drugs have different effects on cancer cells, and therefore, it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time.  Some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell.  Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.  The first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis and RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs. The third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized  aagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.  There are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis. Others stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis. At any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing.  If what you are seeking is "practical" advice, I apologize for rambling on the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs are rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to  experience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small frequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter known as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines tthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications  can be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.  Probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always happen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person  themself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp.  If anyone has seen research on this too, I would love to see it, and possibly some bib data.  I highly recommend making contact with the American Cancer Society. They have a vast selection of literature and information.  In addition, if your friend has had a mastectomy, I highly recommend "Reach for Recovery".

JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of "natural", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is "lossy", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of "realistic" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic "blockiness" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good "quality" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  "Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of the information", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just "high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article "How to find sources". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body.  The "Anonymous FTP List FAQ" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for "canned" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12), file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the "save at normal size" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) "msdos/graphics" at Simtel20, that really means "pd1:<msdos.graphics>".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) "/pub/msdos/graphics".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip     Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip     PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are "AugJPEG", "NewAmyJPEG", "VJPEG", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.  I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The "official" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article "How to find sources", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG "JFIF" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called "color quantization".  (This is something of a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets "smeared" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as "256-color JPEG".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit "hi-color" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying "-Q 100" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say "-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to "do their own thing", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a "low-end" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a "high-end" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported "lowest common denominator"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     "raw JPEG" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   "begin" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   "begin" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different "back end" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The "fair use" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ("ghost" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually "dithered" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to "smooth" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try "-smooth 10" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that "cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For mor

All the clamor  over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical  trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against  cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,  treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals  are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to  use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due  to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden  Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize  the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use  and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is  yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care  patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just  because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that  all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be  found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known  for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a  women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and  not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida  colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common  than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.  The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by  a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is  warrented.  Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There  has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is  kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been  done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the  intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones  from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to  breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of  Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,  increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is  restricting calcium intake.  The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to  be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans  David?  We a

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not  all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  But the vast majority are calcium- oxalate.  Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  I cited that NEJM article  as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that  conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably  always will be.  If one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that  you will be wrong.  As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of  damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to  sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack?).  On the kidney stone problem.  I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical  chemistry lab.  Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of  calcium.  I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to  measure mineral balance in the body.  I know that you don't think that the  serum levels for mineral

Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)    Where are your references?  I have been unable to find studies that state that chromium "cures diabetese".  It can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take.  "High blood pressure" - I have never heard of this claim before.  "... anabolic steroids" - I have also never heard of this claim before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?    |>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place |> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...    I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an important contribution to good health.  It is important to exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).  Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.  Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role in "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin. Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose weight (4).  Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This "protein sparing" effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue.  By "sensitizing" muscle to insulin, chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation of lean body mass has an important long-term positive effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the fat they've lost.  Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin. Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin  stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.  In summary, you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy:    A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.      - Eating fat makes you fat.    B. Increase dietary fiber      - low in calories; high in nutrients.    C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week      - burn calories.    D. Take chromium picolinate daily      - lose fat; keep muscle   References:  1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion). I'll give you some examples.   1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no      demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.   2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid      function for the purpose of quick weight loss.   3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has      been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by      the NCI.  These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should  not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of  which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal  agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be  having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of  commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to  relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures, others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a  chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the  healer's oath, "I will do no harm".  But you know David that very few  treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a  very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each  physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some  are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive  approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long  as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake  in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in  the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as  quacks or even unethical.  What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.   These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the  frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are  really doing a pretty good job of providing "alternative" medicine.  But  many lack any formal training and are in the "business" simply to make a  few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting  competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative  care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find  someone who can help you.  If you are u

Fordham)        The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is  extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal  infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted  2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed  invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The   orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive  for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,  representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon  performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were  tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All  patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent   assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.   The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect  cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of  the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single  most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37  percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were  conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who  was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.   Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive  and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \         =================================================================      "Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV- Infected Surgeon" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)        The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be  quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar  investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a  total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical   procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was  listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for  all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were  obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413  had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No  study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly  detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably  infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369  person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to  patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours  of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to   suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control  guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to  be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was  found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably  the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,   there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive  surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                 April 20, 1993        ==================================================================  "Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10   (Kolata, Gina)        A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly  unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are  undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the  Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He  said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it  had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective  in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that  HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at  different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the  mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one  after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies  do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new  agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data  on new AIDS drugs.  "An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a  much more  efficient way," said Scolnick.  He also said that the   collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,  Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.   Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute  of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, "We're delighted to see the   pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the  information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for  AIDS."

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on  the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of   T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should  not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877  people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving  only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the  proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to  death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The   conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected  individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the  progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study  of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already  appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the   evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has  proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV  infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the  beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of  disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself  provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes   Maddox.        ==================================================================  "Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected  Women" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe  et al.)        A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM  type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of  HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized  that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the   presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in  breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were  enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6  months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were  assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with   protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral  genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of  primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post  partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97  percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;  and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived  longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of  persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1- infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of  HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.   The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM  response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in  breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers  conclude.        ==================================================================                                     April 21, 1993        ==================================================================     "Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture" Journal of Commerce  (04/21/93), P. 7A        A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced  Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS  research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV  infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily  from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies  since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual  AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,  led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come  together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies  involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,  Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,  Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The  participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they  were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively   involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the  collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong  scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR)  was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to  the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of  health professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised  guidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief  Medical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care  workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV   infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.  He said,  "Infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures that  carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus."  The gui
s true is      misleading.  It is not often found effective, particularly by itself.     Primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug     therapy.  The most current theories of this condition attribute      it to more to biological causes than psychological, in places where this     distinction becomes important.  2.  I mentioned that the DSM-IIIR mentions 'impulses' as a possible   diagnostic marker.  However, this might look like something  people associate with psychotic conditions, uncontrollable or  unpredictable behaviors, which is NOT the case with OCD.    One of the diagnostic criteria of OCD is that the individual  can and does suppress some of their 'impulses,' although they  are an unending source of anxiety.    The obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with   OCD are most frequently very mundane and predictable, closer to  a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

e guidelines  also emphasize the significance  of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an  infected health-care  worker.  A model letter to patients who have come into  contact  with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for   health officials on how to deal with the media.  In addition, a  U.K. advisory  panel on HIV infection in health-care workers has  been formed to provide  specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients.  ==================================================================     "Properties of an HIV 'Vaccine'" Nature (04/08/93) Vol. 362, No. 6420, P. 504    (Volvovitz, Franklin and Smith, Gale)        The questions raised by Moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope  glycoprotein precursor from HIV-1 produced by  MicroGeneSys are advantages  rather than disadvantages, write  Franklin Volvovitz and Gale Smith of  MicroGeneSys in Meriden,  Conn.  Moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus  expression  system does not bind strongly to the CD4 receptor, and that this   recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  HIV-1 virus  does in natural infection.  But vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in  patients infected with HIV-1 broadens HIV-1  specific envelope-directed immune  responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and CD4 and  CD8  cytotoxic T-cell responses.  Volvovitz and Smith claim that they  never  intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  Antibody  responses against native HIV-1 proteins,  including the types described by  Moore et al., exist in nearly  all AIDS patients but do not prevent   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 42 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  progression of HIV disease.  In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120- antibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific  activation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which   may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4  binding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added  safety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts,  stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune  function.  Based on  these and other clinical results, MicroGeneSys gp160 was  chosen  by researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden for the  first  phase III vaccine therapy studies, conclude Volvovitz and  Smith.  ==================================================================     "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.  341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)        There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.  The  anti-infective properties of  milk are well documented.  While the numbers of  leukocytes,  concentrations of lactoferrin and IgA, and lymphocyte mitogenic   activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of  lactation to  barely detectable levels, lactoferrin and IgA then  increase from three to  twelve months, with 90 percent of total  IgA in milk being secretory IgA.   Breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory  illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to HIV-positive  mothers.  The Italian National Registry of AIDS discovered that breastfed HIV- 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than  bottlefed infants (9.7 months).  Breastfed children also had a slower  progression to AIDS.  There is no agreement on which  antibodies offer  protection against HIV-1 infection.  Studies of  the biological properties of  milk from 15 HIV-1 infected women  showed the presence of IgG and IgA  antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as IgA antibodies against  core antigens.   Binding of HIV-1 to the CD4 receptor can be inhibited by a  human  milk factor.  In the developing world, where infectious disease  and  malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is  still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's HIV status.   Transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early  milk have been expressed  and discarded.  The possibility remains that breast  milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with HIV at birth and   may even delay progression to AIDS, concludes Mok.  ==================================================================     "Absence of HIV Transmission From an Infected Dentist to His Patients" Journal  of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. 269,  No. 14, P. 1802   (Dickinson, Gordon M. et al.)        If universal precautions are practiced, the risk of HIV  transmission  from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal, write Gordon M.

The  researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with AIDS and  attempts were made to contact all patients for HIV testing.  Living patients  with newly detected HIV infection were interviewed, and DNA sequence  analysis  was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  HIV to that of the  dentist.  Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the  medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug  abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.   There were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124   were deceased.  An examination of the death certificates of  patients  identified five who had died with HIV infection, all of  whom were either  homosexuals or IV-drug users.  The researchers  were able to detect 962 of the  remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  HIV infection was  reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence  of risk  factors for the disease.  One patient who had only a single   evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  Comparative DNA sequence  analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients  were not closely related.  The study  suggests the potential for HIV  transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting  in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude Dickinson  et  al.         ================================================================                                    April 22, 1993         ================================================================    "AIDS Patients are Susceptible to Recurrences of TB, Study Says" Washington  Post (04/22/93), P.

People who contract TB usually  develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria  again.  But a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight  off a  new TB infection, doctors found.  Peter M. Small of the Howard  Hughes  Medical Institute at Stanford University, director of the  study, said that in  order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to  use TB medicines permanently.   The study examined the genetic makeup of TB  bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at Kings County  Hospital  in New York.  ================================================================     "HIV-1 Infection: Breast Milk and HIV-1 Transmission" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol.  341, No. 8850, P. 930  (Mok, Jacqueline)        There are still more questions than answers regarding  HIV-1-positive  women breastfeeding their babies, writes  Jacqueline Mok of the Lancet.

In the Lancet's March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg's   hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to  AIDS, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   However, their hypothesis  that HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.   The U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy,  no prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this  hypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4   depletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies  against HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals  from Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg's drug- AIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug- free AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT   use altogether.  To refute Duesberg's hypothesis Schechter would  have to  produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years  HIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same  AIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.  The 10 year period is claimed by    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  proponents of the HIV hypothesis to be the time needed for HIV to cause AIDS.   Alternatively, they could show that HIV-free  individuals who have used drugs  for 10 years never get  AIDS-defining illnesses, concludes Duesberg.  ================================================================    "Rapid Decline of CD4+ Cells After IFNa Treatment in HIV-1  Infection"  Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 959   (Vento, Sandro et al.)        Interferon (IFN), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases  in some settings, may hasten CD4 T-cell loss in some  HIV-1 infected  individuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions,  write Sandro Vento et al. of the A.  Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.   The researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with  hepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,   profound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the  observation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had  circulating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the  end of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,  contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the   aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens,  homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.   These autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class II molecules and  may contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells "in vivo", were at low tires  (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such   autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and  HCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss  in some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA  antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell  counts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very   rapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with  these HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude.         ================================================================                                    April 23, 1993         ================================================================     "TB Makes a Comeback" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6    (Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.)        Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United  States, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants,  minorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the  University of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung  Association,  said, "Right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's   everyone's problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected  with TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their  immune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.  Gene   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46 Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993  Tammes, a Centers for  Disease Control expert, said that is why the CDC has  issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix AIDS  with TB  patients.  State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because  those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with  treatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public  health services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of  cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George   Diferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to  Diferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of  diagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City  residents don't  complete therapy.  When TB patients don't finish taking their   medication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more  expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to  treat.  ================================================================      "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern  Florida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol.  83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.)        The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in  southern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write  Okey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.   The researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal  Palm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual  transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users,  or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route  of HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records  from social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually  transmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor  was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a   standardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were  reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission  categories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the  percentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties  between January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to  heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men  and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of   heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after  adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the  national average, the researchers  conclude.

[....]  Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker' is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.  I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider themselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10". (This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:     :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.      1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable      systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most      users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is      good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX      hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who      fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One      might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing      limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to      discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password      hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.       The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global      community defined by the net (see {network, the} and      {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see      {hacker ethic, the}).       It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe      oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an      elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new      members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if      you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled      {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.     :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing      is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and      facilitating access to information and to computing resources      wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun      and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits      no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.       Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no      means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe      to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and      giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that      *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary      control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}      project.       Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of      cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.      But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who      see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On      this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy      to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,      preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it      was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an      unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.       The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share      technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing      resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as      {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})      can function without central control because of this trait; they      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be      hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.  :  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is :  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large. : To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who : says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)  Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So, in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.  : >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way. :  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)  Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place, then language is working.  -- |================= #include <stddisclaimer.h> ================///=====
 citizenship while they are/were great Canadian scientists.   About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting.   I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.   Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.   After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy Kidder's "Soul of a New Machine" or some other dramatic technique. The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with  one paragraph biographies.   If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear them.   So far, I have received 68 nominations as follows:     First Name     Last Name      Nominator            Famous For ----------     ---------      ---------            ---------- Sid            Altman         Kuszewski, John      Catalytic RNA(Nobel Chem 89) Frederick      Banting        me                   Insulin (Nobel U23 medicine) Davidson       Black          Stanley, Robert      Discovered Peking Man James R.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but became Americans after graduate school.   Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.   If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop me a line. ==================================================   That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist, "What I was doing when I was 12", So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There  will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well.   I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close  to being it. Hope to find one soon.    I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of  the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.   I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great C

How can they be mimimized? >  > Please respond via e-mail to    rme1@cornell.edu >  > Thanks, > Renee  EDTA(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove  calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such  use).  There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung  disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also  binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when  EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that  were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove  calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C  and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra  vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium  from the plaques).  The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably  can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns  with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.   1. "Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review"     Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with      magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.    2. "The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular       disease" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the       serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be       overemphasized.  This is a review article.   3.

Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of      plaques

(515) 294 1525       April 29, 1992.  Dear Prospective Employer:  I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware,  C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and computer networking.  I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992  from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University.  During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics. These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability to learn new concepts quickly.  I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level.  I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS. I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant, am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform  GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in computer networking.  While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication. I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.  My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer. I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals.  I am eager to hear from you soon.   Sincerely  S.N.

0-444-7000, or           800-522-8877, for the Huntington Medical Research           Institutes.     LOS ANGELES, April 28  -- A new method for diagnosing  and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI) in Pasadena, Calif.  Results of their research will be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal, Radiology.    Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led by Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special software developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical Proton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton MRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination time yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes.  By comparison, the current "standard of care" in testing for Alzheimer's disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the patient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.    In addition to Alzheimer's disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.    "We've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted with either the MRS or PROBE software," said Dr. Ross, adding, "this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer's earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain."    Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker in the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed with Alzheimer's showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their level of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was significantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.    Current drug therapy for Alzheimer's disease is widely considered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross believes, to the theory that Alzheimer's is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer's were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.    "Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate Alzheimer's from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we consider this test a major advancement in medicine," said Bruce Miller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher and a co-author of the study.    Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats, Ph.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley, R.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200 General Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States, and will be configured for other manufacturers' MRI units soon.

Q & A on Alzheimer's Disease:     What is Alzheimer's disease and how is it caused?    Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist Alois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality, loss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.    How many people does it affect?    Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking approximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer's debilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both emotionally and financially, for patients' families.  AD is the most common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every year, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.    What are its signs and symptoms?    Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have been identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk of developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial AD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe "forgetfulness" caused by short-term memory loss.  Dr. Herman Weinreb of the School of Medicine at New York University says "whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree" and suggests the following criteria:     -- Forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is       normal.    -- Forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.    -- Forgetting where you left your keys is normal.    -- Forg
  >and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to  >restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is  >yet a standard part of medical practice.      Nor is it mine.  What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections.  Marty made this sound like a secret  known only to veternarians and biochemists.  Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining "good" anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of my routine practice to "reinnoculate" patients with "good" bacteria after antibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a "logical extension" from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials.    One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate the patients flora.  Don't try this at home.   >not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida  >colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common  >than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.    Except that it isn't.

Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to  >breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of  >Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,  >increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is  >restricting calcium intake.    Seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical trial, like:   AU   Dismukes-W-E.  Wade-J-S.  Lee-J-Y.  Dockery-B-K.  Hain-J-D. TI   A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the      candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome [see comments] SO   N-Engl-J-Med.  1990 Dec 20.  323(25).  P 1717-23.      psychological tests. RESULTS. The three active-treatment regimens      and the all-placebo regimen      significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than      0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms      significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]      CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis      hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or      psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,      the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such      women appears to be unwarranted.    Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.  Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use *Sporanox* (despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin).  Maybe they didn't avoid those carbohydrates . . .   >The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to  >be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy. >If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans  >David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider  >yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as  >Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast  >infections should decline.    Marty, you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms (Noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (Elaine Palmer syndrome) with systemic symptoms.  There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials.  Are we talking about "real" candida infections, the whole "yeast connection" hypothesis, the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans, or the ability of anecdotally effective the
itten the way it was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast connection".  But, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In the meantime, I'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT says "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence (Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with relatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I'm glad I did this, since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you.  Talk to your doctor.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

iced my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals. It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:     1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge    2) one's financial situation takes precedence    3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)    4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"    5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"  or the biggest killer (IMO)     6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's       version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without       the motivation the effort seems useless.  Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember when there were several completely different computer systems, our children are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being taught the "user" mentality.  As the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are not being replaced by the next generation.

WIRE4 - GL wireframe previewer for Steve Hollasch's RAY4 (see above)  Data Formats and Data Sets for Ray Tracing: -------------------------------------------  SPD - a set of procedural databases for testing ray tracers. NFF - simplistic file format used by SPD. OFF - another file format. P3D - a lispy file format. TDDD - Imagine (3D modeler) format, has converters for RayShade, NFF, OFF, etc.  Also includes a nice postscript object displayer.  Some GREAT models. TTDDDLIB - converts to/from TDDD/TTDDD, OFF, NFF, Rayshade 4.0, Imagine,  and vort 3d objects. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric  views in Postscript. Registered users get a TeX PK font converter and  a superquadric surfaces generator.  Glenn Lewis <glewis@pcocd2.intel.com>  [Note : TTDDDLIB is also known as T3DLIB] CHVRTD - Chapel Hill Volume Rendering Test Datasets, includes volume sets for  two heads, a brain, a knee, electron density maps for RNA and others.  Written Material on Rendering: ------------------------------  RT News - collections of articles on ray tracing. RT bib - references to articles on ray tracing in "refer" format. Rad bib - references to articles on radiosity (global illumination). Speer RT bib - Rick Speer's cross-referenced RT bib, in postscript. RT abstracts - collection by Tom Wilson of abstracts of many RT articles. Paper bank project - various technical papers in electronic form.  Contact  Juhana Kouhia <jk87377@cs.tut.fi> Online Bibliography Project :         The ACM SIGGRAPH Online Bibliography Project is a database of          over 15,000 unique computer graphics and computational geometry         references in BibTeX format, available to the computer graphics         community as a research and educational resource.          The database is located at "siggraph.org".  Users may download          the BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to         "siggraph.org" and log in as "biblio" and interactively search         the database for entries of interest, by keyword.         For the people without Internet access, there's also an e-mail         server. Send mail to          archive-server@siggraph.org          and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send         followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is         with the command              send index         which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.          Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,         "bibadmin@siggraph.org".  Image Manipulation Libraries: -----------------------------  Utah Raster Toolkit - nice image manipulation tools. PBMPLUS - a great package for image conversion and manipulation. LIBTIFF - library for reading/writing TIFF images. ImageMagick - X11 package for display and interactive manipulation  of images.  Uses its own format (MIFF), and includes some converters. xv - X-based image display, manipulation, and format converter. xloadimage, xli - displays various formats on an X11 screen. Khoros - a huge, excellent system for image processing, with a visual  programming interface and much much more.  Uses X windows. FBM - another set of image manipulation tools, somewhat old now. Img - image manipulation, displays on X11 screen, a bit old now. xflick - Plays .FLI animation under X11 XAnim - plays any resolution FLI along with GIF's(including GIF89a animation  extensions), DL's and Amiga IFF animations(3,5,J,l) and IFF  pictures(including HAM,EHB and color cycling) SDSC - SDSC Image Tools package (San Diego Supercomputing Center)  for image manipulation and conversion CLRpaint - A 24-bit paint program for SGI 24bit workstations and 8bit Indigos.

Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes ===========================================  Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help. Don't overuse mail servers.  There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these mail servers have a command like    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.  DEC's FTPMAIL -------------   Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,   and having a line containing the word 'help'.   You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you   must follow in order to get the files you want.    Note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work   for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send   requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.   Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com   address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.  BITFTP ------   For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.   Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.   +RED +--- +  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server. +  The Server Sites that are available are: + +  Location        EARN/BITNET          Internet +  --------------  ----------------     ------------------- +  In Turkey:      TRICKLE@TREARN       TRICKLE@EGE.EDU.TR +  In Denmark:     TRICKLE@DKTC11 +  In Italy:       TRICKLE@IMIPOLI +  In Belgium:     TRICKLE@BANUFS11     TRICKLE@UFSIA.AC.BE +  In Austria:     TRICKLE@AWIWUW11 +  In Germany:     TRICKLE@DS0RUS1I     TRICKLE@RUSVM1.RUS.UNI-STUTTGART.DE +  In Israel:      TRICKLE@TAUNIVM      TRICKLE@VM.TAU.AC.IL +  In Netherlands: TRICKLE@HEARN        TRICKLE@HEARN.NIC.SURFNET.NL +  In France:      TRICKLE@FRMOP11      TRICKLE@FRMOP11.CNUSC.FR +  In Colombia:    TRICKLE@UNALCOL      TRICKLE@UNALCOL.UNAL.EDU.CO +  In Taiwan:      TRICKLE@TWNMOE10     TRICKLE@TWNMOE10.EDU.TW + +  You are  urged to use the  one that is closer  to your location. +  Send a message to one of these containing the body + +  /HELP + +  and you'll get more instructions.   Lightwave 3D mail based file-server -----------------------------------   A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images   and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.   The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list   and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for   several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.    The server resides on a BBS called "The Graphics BBS".  The BBS is   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1   908/469-0049.

Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):    New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley   (worley@cup.portal.com)    I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format   called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely   distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.    In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file   with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the   objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various   object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,   Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables   for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views   in Postscript.  P3D ---   From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight   extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp   interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.    The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon   Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D   without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.    The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:   Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,   Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from   VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.    The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

She was two, then, and have been with  continuous colds since until last March.  As spring approaches, her colds slowed down.  Meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds. Only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics.  (The other time was due to sinus infection, and I wished that I did not give her that awful Septra.)   >Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?

Gee, I bet 50/50 you'll hear cases in all these catagories.  > Is there any data on home care vs. day care?  I am pretty sure, an insulated child at home sicks less.

Caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other  kid's mouth nor let other kids do the same.  Cold virus mutate easily. However, I hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases, so she would be less severely affected.  Everytime she has a cold, we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her Dorcol or Dimetapp  at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net). That's about all the care she needs from us.  I try very hard to keep her off antibiotics.  Twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics.  I waited just long enough (3-4 days) to see that she fought the illness off.  I do understand that you don't have much choice if the child is in pain and/or high fever.   >does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it >not have any long term effect?

(7) Detail:     Initialization:       Set default display type to highest display type.       Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).     1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this       menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.       The header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.       pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use         for reading current file.       pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This         program will automatically determine which format this file is.         The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check         standard extension. Still fail, report error.       pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.         If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key           (except ESCAPE).         If any error occurs, program will make a beep. +       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.         ESCAPE to terminate.       pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.       pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting. +     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.     2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.       You can do special effect on image.       pressing RETURN: show image.         in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text         mode.       pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.       pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.       pressing SPACE: save current image to file.         B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).         Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).         Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).         True Color: save as 24-bit image.          This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image         to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program         will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another         directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after         pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change         directory to what you want. Then,          pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.         pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename                       (filename under bar).     3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.    4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,      the performance is poor.    5. If you want to save 8 bits image :        try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...       If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):        try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster        (No one is better for true 24bits image)    6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.    7. Not all subroutines are fully tested    8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,      COMMENT about this program,      Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).      I need your suggestion to improve this program.

y references is very time consuming(took me all  day for that PMS post), I'm not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has  them).  I'm going to include some of the material from Weinsier and  Morgan's new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to  point out that what I'm going to say has some support in the medical  community.  Diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long  time.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I've  already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection. Now I'm going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in  the U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).  When vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as  the anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have  decided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C (which I've already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is  also getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason). The NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if  vitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It's role in  both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).  Vitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and  beta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it's toxic, beta-carotene  is the plant form and it's completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta- carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present (60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other  tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human  adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We  are born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about  30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they  were born with.  If you don't believe that nutritional reserves(like that  of retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is  not going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient  reserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.  The U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of  vitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet  surveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A (either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National  Research Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the  RDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to  7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it's recommendations was  killed.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main  reason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient  reserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to  move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move  towards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have  some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely  important during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that  battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the  1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the  dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the  1940's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill  the reserves).  We know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a  normal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient  reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients. But for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how  much somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has  overfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol  level(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your  liver with vitamin A and it's time to stop taking retinol).  The normal  range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is  diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation  of Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level  of vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to  vitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative  approach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in  this post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty  of warning that it's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache,  redness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).  I tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they  had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear  signs that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient  needs the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you  will always know when it's time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for  PMS studies).  Beta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will  never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to  retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the  liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But  taking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to  fill the liver up(I've seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30%  that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One  other problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not  convert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the  enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of  retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will  cause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.  Now what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body  uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be  nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde (retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the  retinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses  retinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells  and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes,  one of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the  title of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play  a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it's biggest role  is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake  of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But  retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once  it's formed, it's used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC  group wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA's.  Most people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are  helping themselves.  If they don't have much vitamin A in their liver and  they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do  themselves more harm than good.  Retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation. In the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus  production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from  entering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first  line" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown  to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which  stimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration  and cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters  are not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not  normally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process. This is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials  in progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.  Chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that  vitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who  walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be  worked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already  has on it's list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my  course at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic  medical school in Tulsa(OU's branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.  Dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night  vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The  serum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver  reserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have  trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled  out).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels  were measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below  20ug/dl.  As more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of  the U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably  see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low  serum retinol levels.  What do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts from their book:  Vitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for  growth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for  reproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and  metabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid,  which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not  in reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A  status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal  range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are  indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater  than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation  tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to  perform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to  vitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The  bronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal  tract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than  7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts  over 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation,  erythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois (bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.    They recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A  deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol  level is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in  adults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule  out a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical  lab can't run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give  them the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity  should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the  patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.  Both Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A. Recall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A. I don't suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to  fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the  serum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the  vitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a  demonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will  provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status  are good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more  agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But  vitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could  become pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human  fetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is  18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on  the human fetus.  Could just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes  but the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use  retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it  full.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to  prescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.'s in this newsgroup  jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A  supplements for treating patients with

very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the            FACT of "BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS" (reactions like Mg + O            --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as            described in the BOOK "Biological Transmutations" by Louis            Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the            book "THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS" by Peter Tompkins and            Christopher Bird, 1973:                  (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same                     kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]                 (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight                     and number.                 (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper                     for three or four weeks.                 (4) Separately incinerate both groups.                 (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of                     the sprouted group will usually weigh at least                     SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]                 (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for                     mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the                     sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier                     mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen,                     hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]                            BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our            own bodies.                            Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with            carbon, such as "horsetail" extract, or radishes) can SPEED            HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much            faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).                             Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-           organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen,            oxygen, hydrogen, etc..                            The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms,            cause "STONE SICKNESS" in statues, building bricks, etc..                             The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron,            creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators            and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).                            Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY!                             ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF the            currently accepted "laws" of physics, (including the law            which says that atomic fusion requires EXTREMELY HIGH            temperatures and pressures.)

III. ***** NEWS FROM THE WIRES ******  Sender: Jonathan Lord <jml4s@uva.pcmail.virginia.edu> Subject: RESURGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONCERNS CDC Date: Thursday April 15, 1993  ATLANTA (UPI) --   A resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's health care system, federal health officials said Thursday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.  Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled "Emerging Infectious Diseases" to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report, which has a wide circulation in the health community. The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments.  "This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it," said Dr. Ruth Berkelman, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases.  There were more cases of malaria in the U.S. in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s, and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic, the first in this century, she said.  Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem. "We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past" Berkleman said.  She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.  "Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States," the CDC said.  It  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly identified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that causes AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.  "The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas," the CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance.  =====*=====  SOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1 HEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues  The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage: legal liability.  A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property.  The decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical expenses and lost wages.  Summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L. Kass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable.  Lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. A summer vacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant.  But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country -- it's most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.  The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease.  Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years. Payments in worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and lost earnings.  The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of negligence. Unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease.  Ira M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn & Maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease."  Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision, winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten. The workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites.  A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites.  Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness. Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease. And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.  Because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last year, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson & Co. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical- supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected.  Ruth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole Katz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their 100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide.  =====*=====  TITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease. AUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH, Department of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. REFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30  Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended.

REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be   three stages of production.  The first stage will  consist of all participants creating one still   work as a "starter" piece that two other partici-  pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage  "base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993,   midnight Central Daylight Time.    Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will   be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant  for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see   fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist  of filtering the image through their favorite paint  program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be  printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their  own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-  ning in the image again to be transferred on to   the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works  are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.   Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin  on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think   it takes to finish up the image they've been given  using whatever technique they see as worthy.    These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.   All involved will participate in each stage of  creation.   -----------------------------------------------------------  To join, send email/mail with the following info:   Name:  email address:  mail address:  scanner access?

Guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays  that one should have over a given period of time because of all the  environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation  is one of the most potent(splits DNA and causes hydroxyl free radical  formation in tissue cells).  Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus  in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors  in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may  be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care  to comment?).  Most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones,  I don't think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" the  kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium  have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the  aterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could  speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I'm pretty confident that  a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery  is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second  opinion is a good

The secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries have more power than you might realize, and you never know- could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.  > Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i  If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really* want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant other.    If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no, sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point.    Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you say it.  Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses, it usually shows.  Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also. Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out.  Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there, combined with an hon

There were   actually some people who were more careful in their methodology  who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'      One of the most influential critics of Kirlian Electrophotography     is a Theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the     hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic     or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at London's     City University, and a past president of the Society for Psychic Research      named A. J. Ellison.      After years of studying the method and the claims, Ellison     came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we     calls 'Lichtenberg Figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of     the air around the object.  It's a bit more complicated than     'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing     in the end, Kirlian electrophotography has much more limited     value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  Electrical and     magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be     of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and     usually also tracer chemicals.       kind regards,       todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Todd I.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than    realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a    version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).    I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results    (for better or for worse).     I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV    a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where    the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized    a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space    station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between    frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only    5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.     I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot    card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then    imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,    keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled    to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default    "2.00" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten    frames.     I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same "Raw Speed Test" program I used    for the results I'd been reporting earlier.     Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.     That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short    test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard    disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate    was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk    (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.     I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional    scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240    size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who    observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in    action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's    entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...     Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.     The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with    "preferred" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played    from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).    A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was    very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with    ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this    much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task    switching.     A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see    any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight    stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.     I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the    key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also    improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance    even more...

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for "double size" scaling, other scaling factors hit peformance much harder).  (3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).  Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also make a real difference.  Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...  -Peter Lee    -- /-------------------- Peter E. Lee, Software Conductor -----------
.skeptic FAQ (I edit it).  You can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes.  Glaucoma is the Classic Example, but there are probably others.  Iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes.  By looking at the patterns, striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.  The two questions to ask any alternative therapist are:  1: How does it work?  2: What evidence is there?  The answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate.  I don't know about iridology, but I've read a book on reflexology, which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet.  There are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort.  Anatomists have found no such structures. (Always beware the words "channel" and "energy" in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner.)  The answer to question 2 is rather simpler.  If all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it.  Ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals.  Ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners.  Studies are done and papers are published.  Some of them are even positive.  The word "licensed" in the flyer is an interesting one.  Licensed by whom?  For what?  It is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license: you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat, and many plants contain very powerful drugs (Foxglove and Willow spring to mind).  It is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology, and I suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means "(Licensed herbologist) and iridologist".  BTW, the usual term is "herbalist".  Why use a different word?  --  Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).     | Tel: +
ore important than anything else.  In fact, some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities.  Of course, when this happens, don't expect a refund on your $50 application fee.  But, the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically.  You mentioned one response, was it an acceptance, denial, or wait-list?  If I assume the worst, that it was a denial, then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere.  How did your interviews go?  As for how long you have to wait, I've called a few schools who never contacted me for anything.  Many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if I haven't heard by now, I can assume a denial.  Many rejection letters are not sent out until May or as late as June.  But some schools are still interviewing. I really don't think you should worry.  Don't become fixated on the mailbox, go out, have fun, be very proud of yourself.  What do people think of the medical school admissions process?  I had a very mediocre GPA, but high MCAT scores, and I have been working as a software engineer for two years.  I majored in Computer Science at Stanford.  Still, I think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this:  VERY IMPORTANT -------------- GPA: 3.5 or better MCAT:   top 15% in all subject  MEDIUM IMPORTANCE ----------------- Writing/Speaking ability Maturity Motivation for going into medicine Activities  LESS IMPORTANT -------------- College or University Major Work experience Anything else you want them to know   Anyway, you are in good shape.

Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and      look in the gopher directory.        There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.      The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine      "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more      information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,      scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to      in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?  A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize      network lag.       Telnet Public Logins:       Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4 gopher  North America      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201 panda   North America      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America      ecnet.ec             157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan        It is recommended that you run the client software instead of      logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)      and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.    --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?  A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University      of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help      our campus find answers to their computer questions.         It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information      System used by a large number of sites in the world.       Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to      count.        The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:           Internet Gopher Developers       100 Union St. SE #190       Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA       Or via FAX at:         +1 (612) 625-6817  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?  A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.      As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to:               - Search local WAIS indices.        - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher          clients.        - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?  A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :       _The_Whole_Internet_, Ed Kroll, O'Reilly, 1992 (Editors note:                              ..Great book, go out and buy a bunch!)       _The_Internet_Passport: NorthWestNet's Guide to Our World Online"      By Jonathan Kochmer and NorthWestNet.

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to       Computerized Archives.       veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles      in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica       is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.      Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the      gopher protocol.       To try veronica, select it from the "Other Gophers" menu on       Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:       Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace)       Type=1       Port=70       Path=1/veronica       Host=futique.scs.unr.edu  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Q8: What is Available for Biology?  A8: There is an incredible amount of software, data and information     availble to biologists now by gopher.

Med. on the  topic of Colonic Flushing.  I'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a  very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases.  Proving  that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the MD's delight in  pointing out).  The Osteopathic Profession seems to be making better  progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their  techingues work.  The JAOA recently had a study on the use of manipulation  to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or  better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements, and not just  the woman's preception of improvement).  This study was hailed by the JAOA  editors as the turning point in the profession's long struggle to prove  itself to the medical community.  I'm currently trying to get the AOA(American Osteopathic Association) which  has supported most of the Osteopathic research in the U.S. to also support  nutrition education and research.  I've pointed out, in a grant proposal,  that the founder of Osteopathic Medicine(A.T. Still) embraced both diet and  manipulation to set himself apart from the MD's of his time who were pushing  only drugs(Still was himself an MD who got real dissillusioned with drugs  during his service in the Civil War).  He decided that there had to be a  better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being  worse than the disease.  Through his many years of study of the human body,  he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his  students in the U.S's first Osteopathic Medical school.  We now have 17. Still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he  used diet to prevent human disease.  I'm trying to get the Osteopathic  Profession to return to it's roots and beat the MD's to the punch(so to  speak).  Both DO's and MD's in current medical practice have ver

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error.  So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that.  So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood etc. Now you are saying:  >We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,  If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a *lot* easier.  ----------------  >So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there >must be a colormap anyway.

Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this paragraph defeats me.  >Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image >as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image >back to 24 bit image.  Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.  But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:   >>>I wrote something about making color modifications quickly >>>with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file >>>process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.  ---------------  >>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file?

No I don't think so actually.   You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising), manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?  >My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit >image   Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!  >-- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.

What are you saying ???  >XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the >mentioned type images.  Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8 bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem!!   >Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global >changes.   Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.  >In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like >paint program job. >If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the >original 24bit image modified.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an approach clumsy, however.  >Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen >such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention >24bit painting program in 8bit screen...  Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one through.  >>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?  >It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not >designed for that.  As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.  >Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image;   Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who, having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the 8 bit image palette.  Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?  >say, >person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is >expected that the image still is the same.   Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.  >So, XV were designed >without thinking about human interface and how human expect the >program work -- design error.  Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)  Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for. It makes no false claims.  >I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but >it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making >major change to the original design.  If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So  far, you have not done so.  >So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved >images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.  Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it if it is so easy.  Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.  >Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where >'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes >up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however, >even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem. >(Americans: the lift is just an example :)  I think this is a bit of an exageration.  What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...  >Well, my text may be a bit hard reading,   you bet  >hopefully you suggeeded to >read it.  Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language.
