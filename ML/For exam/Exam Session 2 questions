Exam Session 2 questions
1) Multiple choice
a) Fisher co-efficient = Between class variance/within class variance
b) Given  a set of funcions, identify the discriminant function
c) K-means is a convex/non-convex
d) Given 2 datasets normally distributed, and means(mu1 and mu2) not equal,
what is the variance(sigma1 and sigma2) are they equal for data to be linearly separable
e)

2. draw Decision boundary for a set of functions
f(x) = ax+b
f(x) = ax1 + b
f(x) = ax1
f(x) = a max(x1,x2) + b

3. PCA derive PCA given e is a eigne vector, C is a covariance matrix
eCe= and subject to constraint e^2 = 1
Write a code snippet for PCA using np.linalg.svd

4. Kernels and featuremap
	e^(-||x1||)  e^(-||x2||)
	given<xi,xj> = summation of xi.xj

5. Ridge regression Programming
Write predict, evaluate function

f(x) = beta.x+c
beta = (X.T * X)^-1 * X.T * Y
Write mean squared error
